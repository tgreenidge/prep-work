# Write a function, `rec_intersection(rect1, rect2)` and returns the
# intersection of the two.
#
# Rectangles are represented as a pair of coordinate-pairs: the
# bottom-left and top-right coordinates (given in `[x, y]` notation).
#
# Hint: You can calculate the left-most x coordinate of the
# intersection by taking the maximum of the left-most x coordinate of
# each rectangle. Likewise, you can calculate the top-most y
# coordinate of the intersection by taking the minimum of the top most
# y coordinate of each rectangle.
#
# Difficulty: 4/5
